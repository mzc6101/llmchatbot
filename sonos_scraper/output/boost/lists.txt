Boost broadcasts 360° signals through walls and ceilings for flawless coverage.
Streams without interference in the most challenging WiFi environments.
Bypasses your WiFi to create a separate high-performance wireless network just for Sonos speakers. 
Works with either Sonos S2 or Sonos S1 (for Android and iOS).
Your WiFi is slow or temperamental, or your network is already in high demand with streaming video, gaming, and internet usage.
WiFi doesn’t reach all the rooms where you want to use Sonos. Extend the range of your Sonos system by placing a Boost in between the Sonos speaker that’s out of reach and the rest of the Sonos system.
Your network is 5 GHz only (not switchable to 2.4 GHz).
Your router supports only 802.11n (you can’t change the settings to support 802.11b/g/n).
