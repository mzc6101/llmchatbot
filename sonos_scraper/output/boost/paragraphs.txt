If you purchased a Boost to replace a Sonos product that’s connected to your router, first add Boost to your Sonos system, then plug it into your router and move the one that was originally wired.
If you purchased a Boost to extend the range of your Sonos system, place Boost in between the Sonos speaker that’s out of reach and the rest of the Sonos system.
Choose a location that’s close to an electrical outlet (power cord length is 6 ft. / 1.8m), away from heat sources, hidden wiring, gas lines, etc.
Drive an American standard #6 round head screw (metric, M3.5 round head screw) into the wall, leaving a gap between the wall and the screw head (approximately 0.13 in / 3.3mm).
Note
: Pan head screws will also work.
Place Boost on the wall and slide straight down, allowing the screw head to slip behind the smaller end of the keyhole slot on the back of Boost.
Ethernet ports
2-port switch, 10/100 Mbps, auto MDI/MDIX
Network bridging
2-port switch allows a connection to your network or to other Sonos speakers
Extend the range of SonosNet—use a Boost to extend the SonosNet signal to areas that cannot reach the rest of the Sonos system
Wireless connectivity
Works on SonosNet™, a secure AES encrypted, peer-to-peer wireless mesh network dedicated exclusively for Sonos to reduce WiFi interference
