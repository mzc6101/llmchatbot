Quick and easy setup, with only one cable to connect to your TV.
Great sound for compact spaces—versatile design allows you to set it on a credenza, mount it on a wall, or place it inside a TV stand.   
Stream music, radio, podcasts, and more when the TV is off.
Expandable. Add a Sub and two Sonos speakers, like Ones, for 5.1 
surround
 sound.  
Control your Sonos system with the 
Sonos app
 (for Android and iOS).

 when you’re ready to add Ray to your Sonos system.
Volume up (right)
Volume down (left)
Swipe right across the touch controls to skip to the next song.
Swipe left to go to the previous song.
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface at least 2" (50mm) from the TV.
Don’t place vertically or on its side.
Don’t block the TV’s IR sensor.
If put on a shelf, place at the front and keep 2" (minimum) clearance on both sides for best sound quality.
Keep 1" (25 mm) space (minimum) above Ray so you can reach the touch controls. For best sound quality, keep both ends of Ray at least 1" (25 mm) from a wall or other obstruction.
Make sure the touch controls are facing up.
Disconnect existing home theater or surround sound equipment from your TV.
Connect any external devices, like a cable box or DVD player, directly to your TV.
Turn your TV on.
Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port. 
Leave enough space between Ray and your TV so you can reach Ray’s touch controls.
For best sound quality, keep both ends of Ray at least 1' (30cm) from a wall or other obstruction.
