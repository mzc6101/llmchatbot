Remove the protective cap, then connect the optical cable (included) to the optical port on the back of your soundbar.
Remove the protective cap, then connect the optical cable to your TV's optical digital OUT port.
(The TV's optical adapter’s port is “D-shaped”—make sure the connector aligns correctly into the port. Inserting the adapter incorrectly may damage the cable.)
Sonos products for your TV provide full-theater sound and play music too. Create a home theater system by adding a pair of 
rear surrounds
 and a 
Sub
.
Use the Sonos app to adjust sound settings or change the way your home theater speaker works with your TV.

It’s easy to turn two Sonos speakers (same model), or a Sonos Amp and your favorite non-Sonos speakers, into separate right and left channels for your home theater. 
Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.

During setup, surround sound is optimized for your room. These settings are adjustable:
Surrounds
Turn surround sound 
On
 or 
Off
.
TV Level
Adjust surround volume for TV audio.
Music Level
Adjust surround volume for music.
Music Playback
Ambient
 (subtle) or 
Full
 (louder, full range). Doesn't apply to Dolby Atmos Music playback.
Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.
Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in 
Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked. 
Learn more
Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter
 using the Ethernet cable.
EQ
Sonos products ship with preset equalization settings. You can change the sound settings (bass, treble, or loudness) to suit your personal preferences.

Battery Saver

If your TV is wall-mounted, align the top edge of the bracket with the bottom of your TV, leaving at least 2.5 inches (mm) between them.
Mark the screw locations and remove the bracket.
If you’re using wall anchors, use a 5/16" drill bit to drill pilot holes, starting with the hole on the left. Then insert the wall anchors. Don’t use wall anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic. See 
Wall mounting information
.
Position the wall mount bracket over the screw locations, using a level to confirm accuracy. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a power drill to screw the bracket to the wall, making sure the center notch is pointing up.
Using a Phillips head screwdriver, fasten the 2 attachment screws to the back of the soundbar, making sure they are fully tightened.
Remove the protective cap from the optical cable, then connect the power and optical cables to the back of the soundbar.
