 when you’re ready to add Beam (Gen 2) to your Sonos system.
Volume up (right)
Volume down (left)
Touch to play or pause. 
Hold to group with other rooms and products in your Sonos system.
Swipe right to skip to the next song.
Swipe left to go to the previous song.
When the microphone light is on, voice control is on and your voice service is ready to respond.
When the light is off, voice control is off.
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface at least 2" (50 mm) from the TV.
Don’t place vertically or on its side.
Don’t block the TV’s IR sensor.
If put on a shelf, place at the front and keep 2" (minimum) clearance on both sides for best sound quality.
Keep 1" (25 mm) space (minimum) above Beam so you can reach the touch controls.
For best sound quality, keep both ends of Beam at least 1" (30 mm) from a wall or other obstruction.
Disconnect existing home theater or surround sound equipment from your TV.
Connect any external devices, like a cable box or DVD player, directly to your TV.
Turn your TV on.
If your TV has an HDMI ARC (or eARC) port
, connect the HDMI cable to it. 
(HDMI ARC is a special port that looks like a standard HDMI port—it may be on the back or side of your TV. The ports look similar, but the ARC port will be labeled ARC, eARC, or ARC/eARC. If you connect Sonos Beam to a standard HDMI port instead, you won’t hear any sound.)
If your TV doesn’t have an HDMI ARC or eARC port
, you'll need to use the optical adapter: 
Remove the protective cap from the optical adapter, then attach the optical adapter to the HDMI cable. 
Connect the optical adapter to your TV’s optical digital OUT port. 
(The TV's optical adapter’s port is “D-shaped”—make sure the connector aligns correctly into the port. Inserting the adapter incorrectly may damage the cable.)
Sonos Voice Control
: control your whole Sonos system with hands-free ease and unmatched privacy. Sonos Voice Control comes ready to use—it only takes a few seconds to add when you set up your speakers.

Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port. 
Use the Sonos Beam Wall Mount kit (sold separately, available at 
sonos.com
).  Follow the instructions in the kit.
Keep 1" (25mm) space (minimum) above Beam so you can reach the touch controls.
If you’re mounting above the TV, make sure you can reach the touch controls.
For best sound quality, keep both ends of Beam at least 1' (30cm) from a wall or other obstruction.
