Press once to play or pause audio.
Press and hold to group with audio that's playing in another room (or to ungroup).

When the indicator light is on, voice control is available (the microphone switch on the back must also be on).
When the indicator light is off, voice control is off.
Press and hold to pair a new device.
Press once to reconnect.
When the switch is off (down), the microphones are disabled so microphone-enabled features like Trueplay quick tuning and voice services are unavailable. 
When the switch is on (up), microphone-enabled features like Trueplay are available. (Voice services are available if the voice services indicator light on top of the product is also on.)
Ethernet
: Use the Sonos Combo Adapter and an Ethernet cable to connect Era 300 directly to your router if you want to hardwire your speaker (helpful if your WiFi is unstable).
Line-in
: Use either the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter to connect your turntable, CD player, projector, or other device.
Era 300 should be placed indoors and have approximately 2' (.61m) of overhead clearance for optimal sound quality. Placement in an enclosed space like a bookshelf is not recommended as this could impact dispersion and playback clarity.
If you are mounting Era 300 within 2' (.61m) of a ceiling, place it upside down for the best sound.
When Era 300 is placed next to a wall or on a shelf, leave at least 1" (2.5cm) clearance in back and 8” (20.32cm) on each side of the speaker.
Traditional stereo setups often have an ideal place to sit in a room for the best listening experience, but with Era 300 the sound is sent in all directions so you'll experience rich detail no matter where you’re seated.
Both speakers' height should be around ear level and behind your seated position.
Leave at least 8" (20.32cm) clearance around the sides of each speaker.
When both are on, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are available.
When both are off, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are unavailable.
When the universal microphone switch is on and the voice services light is off, Trueplay and other microphone-enabled features are available but voice control is off. 
Sonos Voice Control
: control your whole Sonos system with hands-free ease and unmatched privacy. Sonos Voice Control comes ready to use—it only takes a few seconds to add when you set up your speakers.

Source name

Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay

Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port. 
Fixed height, optimal for home theater surrounds.
Easy assembly.
