Instantly adds a dimension of deep bass impact to your audio listening experience.
Allows placement anywhere because it’s wireless and compact—position it vertically or horizontally on any floor surface.
The top of the acoustic slot doubles as a handle so you can lift it.
Sub (Gen. 3) is compatible with the Sonos 
S2 app
  (for Android and iOS). Earlier Sub models are compatible with either 
S1
 or S2.
Sonos Sub is designed for use with most Sonos speakers, except Sonos Roam, Roam SL, Connect, Port, and Move. Make sure you set up at least one speaker before adding Sub.
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add a Sub to your Sonos system.
Use the acoustic slot as a handle to lift Sub out of the box. You should always bend your knees when lifting heavy objects to avoid undue stress on your back.
Make sure at least one side of the slot is free from obstruction. If you place it vertically against a wall, don’t block the front opening. 
If you place Sub horizontally on the floor, don’t put anything on top of it. Leave at least 1" clearance along the top of Sub if placing under furniture.
Sub is designed to sit on the floor. You can place it in a corner, against the wall, behind, under, or next to any piece of furniture on any kind of floor surface.
Position Sub either vertically or horizontally. If you’re going to use it horizontally, you can attach permanent felt feet. See 
Attach feet
  (optional) for more information.
