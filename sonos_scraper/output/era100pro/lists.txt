Quickstart Guide and legal/warranty information
Era 100 Pro max consumption on PoE+ = 30 W
Era 100 Pro max consumption on PoE = 15.4 W
Dynamic
 / 
Default
. No reservation of power. The power available to the switch port is equal to the power being consumed by the PD, up to the maximum negotiated class type.
Class Based
. The power reserved for the switch port is defined by the maximum PoE class type negotiated when the device is connected to the power sourcing equipment.
Static
. The user can define an amount of power that’s reserved for a switch port, and it can’t be consumed by other ports, regardless of how much power is actually being consumed by the device. In this case, we recommend reserving 30 W for each Era 100 Pro.
Era 100 Pro automatically selects an optimized DSP configuration when mounted in portrait, landscape, or ceiling (pointing downward) orientations.
If you're using Era 100 Pro speakers as surrounds, leave at least 8" (203 mm) clearance around the front of each speaker.
When using Era 100 Pro as standalone speakers or stereo pairs (not zones), you can further fine-tune the sound with Trueplay tuning in the Sonos app. This technology uses the mics in the speaker or your iOS device to measure acoustic reflections then optimizes the sound.
Includes an indexed ball joint for secure, fast, and repeatable device articulation.
Incorporates theft deterrence and cable management to deliver a secure, clean, and premium aesthetic.
Mounts on virtually any surface, in any direction or orientation.
Offers easy access to the RJ45 port, buttons, and touch controls.
2 surface mounts
2 surface brackets
2 short speaker mount screws
When both are on, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are available.
When both are off, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are unavailable.
