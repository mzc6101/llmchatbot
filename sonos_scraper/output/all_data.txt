You can put your speaker just about anywhere. For maximum performance, here's a few guidelines: 
Set Move up on your WiFi, then use the mode switch on the back of Move to switch between Bluetooth and WiFi. When you use Bluetooth for the first time, you’ll need to pair Move with your device. Put it into Bluetooth mode and your mobile device will automatically connect next time.
Charging base
Just set Move on its charging base for easy recharging—no extra wires or cables needed.
Make sure the speaker is seated properly in the base and the charging contacts are touching.

Use your voice to control your Sonos system with any voice-enabled Sonos product—play and control content, turn the volume up or down, and more.
Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.

You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to

Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in 
Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked.

Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter
 using the Ethernet cable.

Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.

Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.

Note
: Sonos speakers sold separately.
Take everything out of the box and place the base in the packaging slot to stabilize it for the next few steps. Unplug your Sonos speaker, and thread the speaker end of the power cord through the opening in the base.
Insert the stem snugly into the base, using the alignment pins to position the power cord channel either in the front or back. Use the 2 black screws and a Phillips-head screwdriver to attach the base.
Route the speaker’s power cord through the speaker platform.
Use the 2 silver screws to attach the speaker platform to the top of the stem, threading the power cable carefully. Snap the bottom plate on with the power cable channel in the back, and mount the platform on the stem.
Plug the power cord back into the speaker and place on the top mount, pulling any extra cable down from the top. Tighten the screws and attach the top cap with the notch facing toward the speaker.
Press the power cord into the stem, working from top to bottom. Pull the excess cable down from the base.
Tilt the Stand forward slightly to wrap the excess cord around the bottom of the base. Plug the speaker’s power cable into the wall and enjoy the music!
The easy-to-install shelf for Sonos One, One SL and Play:1 securely holds your speaker in place—its space-saving design provides a designated space for your speaker.

If you purchased a Boost to replace a Sonos product that’s connected to your router, first add Boost to your Sonos system, then plug it into your router and move the one that was originally wired.
If you purchased a Boost to extend the range of your Sonos system, place Boost in between the Sonos speaker that’s out of reach and the rest of the Sonos system.
Choose a location that’s close to an electrical outlet (power cord length is 6 ft. / 1.8m), away from heat sources, hidden wiring, gas lines, etc.
Drive an American standard #6 round head screw (metric, M3.5 round head screw) into the wall, leaving a gap between the wall and the screw head (approximately 0.13 in / 3.3mm).
Note
: Pan head screws will also work.
Place Boost on the wall and slide straight down, allowing the screw head to slip behind the smaller end of the keyhole slot on the back of Boost.

Boost broadcasts 360° signals through walls and ceilings for flawless coverage.
Streams without interference in the most challenging WiFi environments.
Bypasses your WiFi to create a separate high-performance wireless network just for Sonos speakers. 
Works with either Sonos S2 or Sonos S1 (for Android and iOS).
Your WiFi is slow or temperamental, or your network is already in high demand with streaming video, gaming, and internet usage.
WiFi doesn’t reach all the rooms where you want to use Sonos. Extend the range of your Sonos system by placing a Boost in between the Sonos speaker that’s out of reach and the rest of the Sonos system.
Your network is 5 GHz only (not switchable to 2.4 GHz).
Your router supports only 802.11n (you can’t change the settings to support 802.11b/g/n).

Trueplay puts professional-grade tuning in the palm of your hands. Using the microphone on your iOS device (running iOS 8 or later), Trueplay measures the unique acoustics of your space, then optimizes the EQ so the bass never sounds muddy, harsh, or flat.
Note
: Trueplay tuning isn’t available if VoiceOver is enabled on your iOS device. Turn VoiceOver off in your device settings before tuning your speakers.
You can easily change the Sonos product Sub Mini was paired with during setup. 
Sub Mini is compatible with most amplified Sonos products running S2 software. It's recommended for use with Beam, Ray, One, One SL, and Symfonisk products.

Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.

Battery Saver 
(portable products only)
To save battery life, you can set your portable speaker to power off automatically instead of going to sleep. It won't appear in the Sonos app until it’s powered back on.
Line-In 
(Sonos products with line-in capability)
When a projector, turntable, stereo, or other audio device is connected to a Sonos product, you can adjust these line-in settings: 
Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Sonos products for your TV provide full-theater sound and play music too. Create a home theater system by adding a pair of 
rear surrounds
 and a 
Sub
.
Use the Sonos app to adjust sound settings or change the way your home theater speaker works with your TV.

If your TV is wall-mounted, place the positioning guide against the wall, aligning the top edge with the bottom of your TV. There should be 5.5" (140mm) between the top of the wall mount bracket and the TV.
Mark the screw locations and remove the guide. 
If you’re using the included wall anchors, use a 5/16" drill bit to drill the pilot holes and then insert the wall anchors. Don’t use the anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic.
Position the wall mount bracket over the marked screw locations, using a level to confirm accuracy. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a power drill to screw the bracket to the wall, making sure the arrows in the center are pointing up.
Screw the 2 knobs into the back of the soundbar until they are fully tightened.
Connect the power and HDMI cables to the back of the soundbar.
Note
: If you’re connecting the cables to the TV at this time, be sure to plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV.
Slide the soundbar down so the knobs fit into the slots on the wall bracket. Make sure the touch controls are facing up and the soundbar is fully seated.

Feel sound all around you with the spacious 3D experience of Dolby Atmos.
Stream music, radio, podcasts, and more when the TV is off.
Effortless setup with just two cables.
Elegant design discreetly mounts to the wall or sits on a credenza beneath the TV.
Flexibility to expand your system over time and enjoy true 
surround sound
 and multi-room listening. 
Control your Sonos system with the 
Sonos app
 
(for Android and iOS).
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add Arc to your system.
Volume up (right)
Volume down (left)
Swipe right across the touch controls to skip to the next song.
Swipe left to go to the previous song.
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface.
Keep 4" (102mm) space (minimum) between the top of the soundbar and the bottom of your TV (if placing soundbar below the TV).
Don't place vertically or on its side.
Make sure the touch controls are facing up.
Disconnect existing home theater or surround sound equipment from your TV.
Connect any external devices, like a cable box or DVD player, directly to your TV.
Turn your TV on.
If your TV has an HDMI ARC (or eARC) port
, connect the HDMI cable to it.
(HDMI ARC is a special port that looks like a standard HDMI port—it may be on the back or side of your TV. The ports look similar, but the ARC port will be labeled ARC, eARC, or ARC/eARC. If you connect the Sonos soundbar to a standard HDMI port instead, you won’t hear any sound).
If your TV doesn’t have an HDMI ARC or eARC port
, you'll need to use the optical adapter:
Remove the protective cap from the optical adapter, then attach the optical adapter to the HDMI cable.
Connect the optical adapter to your TV’s optical digital OUT port.
(The TV's optical adapter’s port is “D-shaped”—make sure the connector aligns correctly into the port. Inserting the adapter incorrectly may damage the cable).
Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port. 
Use the Sonos Arc wall mount kit (sold separately on 
www.sonos.com
). Follow the instructions in the kit.
Keep 4.0" (102 mm) space (minimum) between Arc/Arc SL and your TV.
Make sure the touch controls are facing up.
For best sound quality, keep both ends of the soundbar at least 1' (30cm) from a wall or other obstructions.

Era 100 Pro is optimized for PoE+ and compatible with standard (legacy) PoE. Sonos recommends pairing Era 100 Pro with a PoE+ switch or Power Injector for maximum performance.
PoE (802.3af)
15.4 W
PoE+ (802.3at)
30 W
Important
: If connected to a PoE++ power source, Era 100 Pro will negotiate PoE+ class type and consume no more than 30 W.
A Power over Ethernet (PoE or PoE+) switch is the most common way you’ll power your Era 100 Pros. With a PoE switch, you can simply run an Ethernet cable from a PoE+ port on the switch to an Era 100 Pro.
When deciding what switch you’ll use, make sure there are enough PoE ports to power all the speakers in the install. 1 speaker = 1 PoE port.
Category 5 (CAT5e) cable or better
Any CAT5 or better ethernet cable up to the 328 ft (100 m) maximum distance allowed by the ethernet standards.
Sonos recommends CAT6 networking cables for installation.
Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)
A device that provides power and network connectivity to speakers using Ethernet cables. Era 100 Pro is optimized for PoE+ but can be used with a standard PoE switch.
In limited use cases, a PoE injector can be placed between your standard network switch and the Era 100 Pro that you want to power. It passes through the Ethernet data from the network switch with the addition of power on the speaker.
At a high-level, PoE budgeting is basic math, but it's a crucial part of installing PoE devices. You need to make sure there’s enough power available for all the connected speakers and other PoE devices.
The PoE budget is the total amount of power available on the network switch, to power your speakers or other PoE devices.
The PSE you use will have a set amount of power it can provide both overall and per port, depending on the switch you choose.
Important: 
Switches are often unable to deliver maximum PoE power on all switch ports simultaneously.
To calculate the budget, consider the PoE switch as a whole, the ports available, and the devices you want powered when they connect to your PSE.
Unlike typical PoE devices (cameras, IP phones, control interfaces) that draw a static amount of power at all times, PoE speakers present a dynamic load to the power source and will draw more power at higher volume levels.
For the purposes of your system maximum power consumption, remember that:
Multiply the number of Era 100 Pro speakers you have by the power they each need (30 W each for PoE+, 15.4 W each for PoE). Then, multiply the total power needed by the industry standard headroom of 20% (1.2x).
Example:
8 Era 100 Pros x 30 W = 240 W of power needed
240 W total power x 1.2 (headroom) = 
288 W total power recommended
Adding the 20% for headroom is an industry best practice and ensures that the switch is not operating at its own maximum capacity. If improper budgeting occurs and the connected products try to draw more power than available, the switch may shut down and disconnect all devices attached, possibly bringing down the network with it.
Important
: If you're adding other PoE devices (security cameras, doorbells, intercoms, lighting, etc.) in addition to your Era 100 Pro(s), these also need to be accounted for in your PoE budgeting calculations.
Sonos Era 100 Pro is 
optimized
 for PoE+ (IEEE 802.3at), 
compatible
 with PoE (IEEE 802.3af), and has been tested to standards defined by the Ethernet Alliance.
The power sourcing equipment (PSE) must be compatible with one of those IEEE standards. For a list of equipment that has been verified by the Ethernet Alliance, please visit their certified products list: 
https://ea-poe-cert.iol.unh.edu/
Before selecting a switch, consider how many networked devices on the system will require PoE power, how much power they draw, as well as the power budget available on the switch(es) you’re considering.
Era 100 Pro can also use WiFi to connect to the network when a wired connection from a PoE switch is not possible (materials, distance, etc).
This can be done with the use of a PoE injector (the injector will provide power, not data).
Using this feature will require the Era 100 Pro to be connected to the SSID of the wireless access point. If there is another wireless Sonos device already on the network, Era 100 Pro will automatically receive the wireless network credentials and password. If there is not already another Sonos device connected to the wireless network, you will need to perform the initial Era 100 Pro setup with a wireless connection to the network.
Passive PoE is not ratified by the IEEE and therefore it’s not a standard. Passive PoE does not include a digital “handshake” or safety check when devices are connected together, which can cause a passive PoE switch to overload an IEEE PoE device.
Passive PoE is normally used in closed systems where the hardware vendor supplies both the PSE and the connected devices, with certainty that nothing else will be used on that network.
There are no standards defining the maximum voltage, current, or power that can be delivered by passive PoE equipment, so it’s very easy to damage PoE devices that are not specifically designed for passive PoE.
Don’t use a passive PoE switch or power injector with Era 100 Pro.
Some PoE switches allow the user to reserve power for some, or all, network switch ports.
Power management modes that might be present on your PSE include:
Era 100 Pro supports all of the above modes.
Era 100 Pro requires an internet connection on either its wired or wireless network interfaces for setup, media streaming, and management (like with our Sonos Pro service, currently only available in the US).
Era 100 Pro is the first Sonos product that does not use spanning tree protocol (STP) in either wired or wireless modes.
The Era 100 Pro wireless network interface is disabled whenever a valid network link is detected on the wired ethernet interface. To enable wireless networking, provide power but no network link on the wired ethernet connection. This can be achieved by using the power output of a PoE Injector, without connecting the PoE Injector data source to a network switch.
Era 100 Pro sounds great no matter where you place it (indoor use only). Here are some guidelines to get you started:
Era 100 Pro is mountable on virtually any surface including concrete, brick, masonry, or wood.
Each custom-designed Era 100 Pro Surface Mount package includes:
Note
: Era 100 Pro sold separately.
Era 100 Pro is mountable on virtually any surface including concrete, brick, masonry, or wood.
When used in conjunction with the Surface Mount, the Era 100 Pro can be mounted in virtually any orientation, on both walls and ceilings.
The bracket enables cables to come through a surface and into the center of the bracket, or pass through the bracket along the surface if you are not able to  drill holes.
‎‎Through bracket cable management
Through wall cable management
The bracket allows for multiple hardware and hole configurations, depending on the surface you are mounting into. We recommend a minimum of 2 mounting points.
Recommended hardware:
Screw head
: Countersunk / Flathead
Max Ø = 9.5 mm
Min Ø = 7 mm
Screw diameter
:
Max Ø = 5 mm
When mounting on a wall, make sure the bracket is oriented with the arrows pointing up.
Double-check the spacing to ensure the speaker will fit in your desired orientation.
Important
: You won’t be able to access the release mechanism if it's too close to an obstacle, e.g. a ceiling, in the wrong orientation. Double check placement if mounting near a corner.
When mounting on a ceiling, make sure the bracket is oriented with the arrows pointing towards the closest wall.
Double check the spacing to ensure the speaker will fit in your desired orientation.
Important
: You won’t be able to access the release mechanism if it's too close to an obstacle, e.g. a wall, in the wrong orientation. Double check placement if mounting near a corner.
Rotate the speaker so the screw hole is facing up. Attach the speaker to the mount using 1 short speaker mount screw (included).
We recommend attaching Era 100 Pro to the mount first, before attaching the mount to the bracket. For two reasons:
Align the mount with the bracket keyhole slot, then slide the mount down to lock it into place. When correctly mounted, you will hear a click. This click is the theft prevention lock. 
Make sure the mount and speaker are securely seated and the theft prevention lock is engaged.
To adjust its articulation, unlock the mount by rotating the collar counterclockwise. Reposition the speaker, then rotate the collar clockwise, and tighten by hand.
To unlock the theft prevention mechanism, push a small tool (e.g. a thin screwdriver or pick) into the hole located behind and underneath the twist lock.
Tool ax Ø = 4.5 mm
Tool Min Length = 30 mm
If a safety tether is required, attach it to the speaker using the included eyebolt attachment.
The Era Pro Surface Mount is compatible with Era 100 with some limitations. The Era 100 does not have a hook receptacle, so you will need to remove the hook from the Surface Mount using the instructions below. Sonos recommends to only use Era 100 in a vertical orientation (not landscape or ceiling mounted) since it does not have the added stability from the hook.
It's also not possible to attach a safety tether to Era 100.
Unscrew the hook from the mount.
Remove the hook and re-attach the screw with 4-5 Nm torque.
Set up zones in the Sonos app to better fill large spaces with sound. A zone is a new semi-permanent configuration for multiple speakers throughout a system. Zones can be a single room, half of a room, or even multiple rooms.
Once a zone is created, it keeps the speakers configured as one unit until the user removes the zone in System Settings 
. You can place a maximum of 16 devices into a zone. To ensure the best experience, we recommend a wired internet connection into each speaker. If a wireless connection is needed, we recommend not exceeding six (6) WiFi connected devices per zone. The maximum number of Sonos devices per system is 32.
Once you create a zone, all products in it are accessed together. Swipe up on the
 Now Playing
 bar, or navigate to the 
output selector 
 to control all products in a zone at once.
An established zone appears as a single connected set of speakers in the app interface. Instead of having to give multiple products a common name in the same space (e.g. Kitchen, Kitchen 2, Kitchen 3, etc.) they look like one, single player in the
 output selector
 
 and system view.
After selecting 
+ Set Up Zone
, the app will take you through setup.
Select the products you want to add to the zone.
Go to 
System Settings
 
 and select a zone.
Under 
Products
, select either 
Edit Zone
 to reconfigure a zone or 
Separate Zone
 to disband all speakers in the zone. 
In 
System Settings
 
, you can adjust the relative volume of each speaker in a zone using the 
Volume Trim
 control.
In 
System Settings 
, you can adjust 
EQ
 for each speaker to compensate for speaker position, architectural elements, surface materials, etc.
Select the speaker icon 
 in the app to identify individual speakers in a zone when adjusting sound settings. The speaker you selected will play a tone and flash its LEDs for audible and visual feedback.
Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you place it.
Note
: You can't perform Trueplay tuning on a zone.
Advanced tuning takes about 45 seconds and uses the microphone on an iOS device (running iOS 8 or later) so you'll move around the room while the sound is fine tuned for your space.
Note
: Advanced tuning is the best choice for large rooms (open concept spaces may experience less precise tuning).
Quick tuning takes about 10 seconds and uses the microphone on your Sonos product to detect the environment so there's no need to move around the room during tuning.
Note
: Quick tuning is available for both iOS and Android, and is a good choice for smaller rooms, or spaces where it's difficult to move easily.
There are 2 ways to enable or disable the microphone and voice services on Era 100 Pro:
When the microphone switch is on and the voice services light is off, TrueplayTM and other microphone-enabled features are available but voice control is off.
You can add Sonos Voice Control, or a voice assistant you use often, for hands-free control of your Sonos system. 
Voice control is off by default.
Note
: If you're adding a voice assistant, download the voice assistant's app before adding it to your Sonos system.

Quickstart Guide and legal/warranty information
Era 100 Pro max consumption on PoE+ = 30 W
Era 100 Pro max consumption on PoE = 15.4 W
Dynamic
 / 
Default
. No reservation of power. The power available to the switch port is equal to the power being consumed by the PD, up to the maximum negotiated class type.
Class Based
. The power reserved for the switch port is defined by the maximum PoE class type negotiated when the device is connected to the power sourcing equipment.
Static
. The user can define an amount of power that’s reserved for a switch port, and it can’t be consumed by other ports, regardless of how much power is actually being consumed by the device. In this case, we recommend reserving 30 W for each Era 100 Pro.
Era 100 Pro automatically selects an optimized DSP configuration when mounted in portrait, landscape, or ceiling (pointing downward) orientations.
If you're using Era 100 Pro speakers as surrounds, leave at least 8" (203 mm) clearance around the front of each speaker.
When using Era 100 Pro as standalone speakers or stereo pairs (not zones), you can further fine-tune the sound with Trueplay tuning in the Sonos app. This technology uses the mics in the speaker or your iOS device to measure acoustic reflections then optimizes the sound.
Includes an indexed ball joint for secure, fast, and repeatable device articulation.
Incorporates theft deterrence and cable management to deliver a secure, clean, and premium aesthetic.
Mounts on virtually any surface, in any direction or orientation.
Offers easy access to the RJ45 port, buttons, and touch controls.

Bluetooth button
USB-C port
The USB-C port is designed for line-in and Ethernet connections using the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter (sold separately). It's not a power source for the speaker and shouldn't be used to charge other devices.
Universal microphone switch 
Toggle to turn all product microphones on or off.
Note
: To use voice services, both the microphone switch and the voice services indicator light must be on.
You can put your speaker just about anywhere. For the best performance, here's a few guidelines: 
Connect an audio device, like a projector, CD player, or turntable (with a built-in phono preamp), to any Sonos product that has a line-in port (Era 300, Era 100, Amp, Port, or Five). Then go to 
 > 
Line-In 
to select the source and start playback.
Note
: Era 300 and Era 100 require a Sonos Line-In or Combo Adapter (
sold separately
). Other products may require a different type of line-in adapter depending on your audio source.      
Learn more
There are two ways to control the microphones on Era 100: 
A universal microphone switch on the back of Era 100 turns all microphones on and off.
A voice services button on top of Era 100 turns voice services on and off without affecting the microphones needed for Trueplay and other microphone-dependent features. 
Use your voice to control your Sonos system with any voice-enabled Sonos product—play and control content, turn the volume up or down, and more.
Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you place it.
During setup, choose the Trueplay option that works best for you and your space. To retune later, go to 
 > 
System
, choose a room, and select 
Trueplay
. 
Advanced tuning is custom and precise. It takes about 5 minutes and uses the microphone on an iOS device (running iOS 8 or later) so you'll move around the room while the sound is fine tuned for your space. 
Note
: Advanced tuning is the best choice for large rooms (open concept spaces may experience less precise tuning).
Quick tuning is fast, effortless, and accessible. It takes about a minute and uses the microphone on your Sonos product to detect the environment so there's no need to move around the room during tuning. 
Note
: Quick tuning is available for both iOS and Android, and is a good choice for smaller rooms, or spaces where it's difficult to move easily. 
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.
Learn more
It’s easy to turn two Sonos speakers (same model), or a Sonos Amp and your favorite non-Sonos speakers, into separate right and left channels for your home theater. 
Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.
Learn more
 
During setup, surround sound is optimized for your room. These settings are adjustable:
Surrounds
Turn surround sound 
On
 or 
Off
.
TV Level
Adjust surround volume for TV audio.
Music Level
Adjust surround volume for music.
Music Playback
Ambient
 (subtle) or 
Full
 (louder, full range). Doesn't apply to Dolby Atmos Music playback.
You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.
Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in 
Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked. 
Learn more
Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter
 using the Ethernet cable.
EQ
Sonos products ship with preset equalization settings. You can change the sound settings (bass, treble, or loudness) to suit your personal preferences. 
Learn more
Trueplay
Trueplay adapts the sound for your surroundings and content. Portable products can tune themselves automatically. 
Learn more
Volume Limit
You can set a maximum volume for each room.

Status Light
Displays the speaker’s connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors.

Note
: If the light is distracting, you can turn it off in 
Settings
.
Touch Controls
You can disable the touch control on your speaker. You may want to do this to prevent a child or curious pet from accidentally adjusting playback or volume.

Battery Saver 
(portable products only)
To save battery life, you can set your portable speaker to power off automatically instead of going to sleep. It won't appear in the Sonos app until it’s powered back on.
Line-In 
(Sonos products with line-in capability)
When a projector, turntable, stereo, or other audio device is connected to a Sonos product, you can adjust these line-in settings:

Each Sonos Era 100 Stand assembly includes:
Note
: Sonos speakers sold separately.
Take everything out of the box and place the base in the packaging slot to stabilize it for the next few steps. Thread the end of the Sonos Era 100 power cord that attaches to the speaker through the opening in the stand base and into the pole channel.
Caution
: This stand is intended only for use with Sonos Era 100.
Position the washer with the alignment pins facing in. Then align the stand pole with the base, using the alignment pins to guide you.
Fasten the base (with the washer) to the stand pole using 1 long screw (included) and a Phillips-head screwdriver. Make sure the cord can still slide freely.
Use the alignment pins to position the speaker platform on the pole, then attach the speaker platform to the stand pole using the other long screw (included).
Bring the power cord up to the speaker and plug it in, then neatly press the power cord into the cable channel on the pole, working from top to bottom.
Attach the speaker to the platform using the short screw (included).
Snap the pole cap onto the top of the stand pole to hide the power cord.
Plug the speaker into a power outlet, then tuck the excess cord under the base.
Important
: This mount is intended for use with Sonos Era 100 in a vertical orientation, as the acoustic and wireless performance of the speaker has been optimized for a standard table-top orientation.
Each custom-designed Sonos Era 100 wall mount assembly includes:
Note
: Sonos speakers sold separately.
Place the bracket against the wall using a level to make sure it’s aligned, and mark the screw holes. Remove the bracket.
If you’re using wall anchors, use a 5/16" drill bit to drill 2 pilot holes, starting with the hole on the top. Then insert the wall anchors. (Don’t use wall anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic.)
If you’re not using wall anchors, locate a wall stud and drill the pilot holes with a 9/64" bit.
Place the bracket against the wall with the arrows facing up. Secure it using 2 long wall bracket screws (included) and a power drill or Phillips-head screwdriver. Drive the top screw in halfway. Drive the bottom one in all the way, then tighten the top screw.
Thread the power cord through the opening at the back of the mount and plug it into the speaker.
Rotate the speaker 180 degrees so the screw hole is facing up. Attach the speaker to the mount using 1 short speaker mount screw (included).
Align the mount with the bracket keyhole, slide the mount down, and lock it into place. Make sure the mount and speaker are securely seated before removing your hand.
To adjust for optimal sound, unlock the speaker by rotating the collar on the mount 90° counterclockwise. Reposition the speaker, then rotate the collar 90° clockwise to lock.

Ethernet
: Use the Sonos Combo Adapter and an Ethernet cable to connect Era 100 directly to your router if you want to hardwire your speaker (helpful if your WiFi is unstable).
Line-in
: Use either the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter to connect your turntable, CD player, or other device.
When the switch is off (down), the microphones are disabled so microphone-enabled features like Trueplay quick tuning and voice services are unavailable. 
When the switch is on (up), microphone-enabled features like Trueplay are available. (Voice services are available if the voice services indicator light on top of the product is also on.) 
Era 100 is made to give you powerful sound anywhere—Trueplay tuning balances the sound for wherever it's placed, and whatever you're listening to. 
When Era 100 is placed next to a wall or on a shelf, leave at least 1" (2.5 cm) of space around the back of the speaker for best performance.
If you're using Era 100 speakers as surrounds, leave at least 8" (203 mm) clearance around each speaker.
When both are on, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are available.
When both are off, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are unavailable.
When the universal microphone switch is on and the voice services light is off, Trueplay and other microphone-enabled features are available but voice control is off.

This original Sonos app can be downloaded on your mobile device to control your older products. Products released after May 2020 aren’t compatible with the S1 Controller app. If you have both older and newer products, you can unplug your older products, or upgrade them; or you can create two separate systems—one running S2 with products that are S2 compatible and another running S1 with products that are not.

Use your voice to control your Sonos system with any voice-enabled Sonos product—play and control content, turn the volume up or down, and more.
Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.

Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)

For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked.

Choose 0° or 180° to set the phase control for your Sonos Sub or third-party subwoofer (flip if you don't hear enough bass in your usual listening position).
When a room with a Sonos Sub is tuned using Trueplay, phase control is set and can't be changed unless you disable Trueplay.
Reset

You can easily change the Sonos speaker your Sub 4 is paired with. 
Note
: If you unplug your Sub from power and plug it back in somewhere else, wait for the status light to stop flashing and turn solid white before changing its settings.
You can pair the Sub 4 with a different Sonos product or choose not to use it right now. It will appear as "unused" in your list of products until you pair it with another Sonos speaker.

Pulse-pounding bass. 
Dual Sonos-engineered drivers generate deep, dynamic low frequencies. The ported enclosure enhances the bass response so you feel every beat, roar, and rumble in your chest.
Transform your home theater experience. 
Pair Sub 4 with Sonos Arc, or Beam for dramatically deeper bass and clearer highs that draw you deeper into movies, shows, and games.
Bring your music to life.
 Hear the nuance in every note and enjoy a greater sense of spaciousness when you pair Sub 4 with Sonos Five, Era 300, or Era 100.
Iconic design.
 With its elegant sculptural shape and updated matte finish, Sub 4 is designed to look great in your home and to match your Sonos speakers.
Place it where and how you want.
 Sub 4 reliably connects to your Sonos soundbar or speaker over WiFi so you can place it anywhere in the room—even on its side and under your sofa.
Use the acoustic slot as a handle to lift Sub 4 out of the box. You should always bend your knees when lifting heavy objects to avoid undue stress on your back.
Make sure at least one side of the slot is free from obstruction. If you place it vertically against a wall, don’t block the front opening. 
If you place Sub 4 horizontally on the floor, don’t put anything on top of it. Leave at least 1" clearance along the top of Sub 4 if placing under furniture.
Sub 4 is designed to sit on the floor. You can place it in a corner, against the wall, behind, under, or next to any piece of furniture on any kind of floor surface.
Position Sub 4 either vertically or horizontally. If you’re going to use it horizontally, you can attach permanent felt feet.

Volume Control
Touch and hold to quickly change the volume.
Note
: You can also use the Sonos app and 
voice control
 to adjust volume.
Play/Pause
Next/Previous
Note
: You can’t skip forward or go back when listening to a radio station.
Microphone
Tap to turn the microphone on or off:
Note
: If you’ve installed a voice service and the microphone is off, you can still use voice commands. Just press and hold 
—no need to start with a wake word. When you release the microphone button, voice control turns off again.
Status light
Displays the product's connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors. 
Learn more
Note
: If you don’t want to allow playback or volume adjustments using the speaker touch controls, you can disable them in the room’s settings.
Join button
Press to connect to your Sonos system during setup.
Ethernet port
Use an Ethernet cable if you want to connect to a router, computer, or network-attached storage (NAS) device (optional).
AC power (mains) input
Use only the supplied power cord (using a third-party power cord will void your warranty).
Note
: Insert the power cord firmly until it is flush with the bottom of the speaker.
You can put your speaker just about anywhere. For maximum performance, here are a few guidelines: 
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.
Learn more
It’s easy to turn two Sonos speakers (same model), or a Sonos Amp and your favorite non-Sonos speakers, into separate right and left channels for your home theater. 
Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.
Learn more
 
During setup, surround sound is optimized for your room. These settings are adjustable:
Surrounds
Turn surround sound 
On
 or 
Off
.
TV Level
Adjust surround volume for TV audio.
Music Level
Adjust surround volume for music.
Music Playback
Ambient
 (subtle) or 
Full
 (louder, full range). Doesn't apply to Dolby Atmos Music playback.
Use your voice to control your Sonos system with any voice-enabled Sonos product—play and control content, turn the volume up or down, and more.
Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
The microphone is used for voice control and for microphone-dependent features like Trueplay tuning. Press 
 to turn the microphone on or off—the microphone LED light will let you know when your voice assistant is listening.

Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.
Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in 
Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked. 
Learn more
Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter
 using the Ethernet cable.
EQ
Sonos products ship with preset equalization settings. You can change the sound settings (bass, treble, or loudness) to suit your personal preferences. 
Learn more
Trueplay
Trueplay adapts the sound for your surroundings and content. Portable products can tune themselves automatically. 
Learn more
Volume Limit
You can set a maximum volume for each room. 
Learn more
Status Light
Displays the speaker’s connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors. 
Learn more
Note
: If the light is distracting, you can turn it off in 
Settings
.
Touch Controls
You can disable the touch control on your speaker. You may want to do this to prevent a child or curious pet from accidentally adjusting playback or volume.

Battery Saver 
(portable products only)
To save battery life, you can set your portable speaker to power off automatically instead of going to sleep. It won't appear in the Sonos app until it’s powered back on.
Line-In 
(Sonos products with line-in capability)
When a projector, turntable, stereo, or other audio device is connected to a Sonos product, you can adjust these line-in settings:

Note
: Sonos speakers sold separately.
Take everything out of the box and place the base in the packaging slot to stabilize it for the next few steps. Unplug your Sonos speaker, and thread the speaker end of the power cord through the opening in the base.
Insert the stem snugly into the base, using the alignment pins to position the power cord channel either in the front or back. Use the 2 black screws and a Phillips-head screwdriver to attach the base.
Route the speaker’s power cord through the speaker platform.
Use the 2 silver screws to attach the speaker platform to the top of the stem, threading the power cable carefully. Snap the bottom plate on with the power cable channel in the back, and mount the platform on the stem.
Plug the power cord back into the speaker and place on the top mount, pulling any extra cable down from the top. Tighten the screws and attach the top cap with the notch facing toward the speaker.
Press the power cord into the stem, working from top to bottom. Pull the excess cable down from the base.
Tilt the Stand forward slightly to wrap the excess cord around the bottom of the base. Plug the speaker’s power cable into the wall and enjoy the music!
The easy-to-install shelf for Sonos One, One SL and Play:1 securely holds your speaker in place—its space-saving design provides a designated space for your speaker.

Power your passive speakers, create your dream smart home, and enjoy endless possibilities for multiroom listening.
Play music through your favorite speakers
Enhance your TV sound
Connect Amp to your TV to create the ultimate entertainment system.
(For even deeper sound, add a Sonos Sub or connect a third-party subwoofer.)
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add Amp to your Sonos system.
Status light
Displays the product's connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors.

Volume control
Touch and hold to quickly change the volume.
Play/Pause
Touch to play or pause sound.
Next/Previous
(Music only)
Note
: You can’t skip forward or go back when listening to a radio station.
HDMI ARC
Use an HDMI cable to connect Amp to your TV’s HDMI ARC port.
Ethernet ports
Use an Ethernet cable if you want to connect to a router, computer, or network-attached storage (NAS) device (optional).
Join button
Press to connect during setup.
AC power (Mains) port
Use only the supplied power cord (using a third-party power cord will void your warranty).
Note
: Insert the power cord firmly.
Analog audio in
Use a standard RCA audio cable (included) to connect Amp's analog audio inputs to the outputs on another device, like a pre-amplified turntable or portable music player.
Subwoofer output
Connect a powered subwoofer to this output using a standard RCA cable. The system will detect when a cable is connected to the subwoofer output and adjust the crossover frequency automatically.
Note
: If you disconnect your subwoofer, make sure to also disconnect the subwoofer’s cable from the Amp output.
Speaker terminals
Use high-quality speaker wire to connect your speakers to Amp.
You can place Amp just about anywhere—in an electronics rack, on a shelf, or on a credenza with your TV.
Rack mounted
Placed on a credenza
Make sure your speakers are compatible with Amp:
Remove the cap from the banana plug to reveal the connection hole.
Insert the stripped end of the speaker wire into the hole, then put the cap back on the banana plug to secure the connection.
Note
: Connect the red (+) and black (-) terminals from each speaker to the corresponding banana plugs and terminals on Amp. Mismatching of polarities will result in weak central sound and a distorted sense of sound direction.
Insert the banana plug into the proper speaker terminal on the back of Amp.
Repeat to install the other speaker wires.
Connect the power cord and plug in Amp.
If you're connecting Amp to your TV, use an HDMI cable to connect from Amp's 's HDMI port to your TV.  
When connected, Amp creates two front audio channels and plays your TV sound through your favorite non-Sonos speakers.
Connect an audio device, like a projector, CD player, or turntable (with a built-in phono preamp), to any Sonos product that has a line-in port (Era 300, Era 100, Amp, Port, or Five). Then go to 
 > 
Line-In 
to select the source and start playback.
Note
: Era 300 and Era 100 require a Sonos Line-In or Combo Adapter (
sold separately
). Other products may require a different type of line-in adapter depending on your audio source.      
Learn more
Amp plays audio in stereo by default. You can change the sound settings for the room associated with the Port so it plays in two mono channels when playing music.

Amp features a built-in state-of-the-art digital amplifier that can power large or small speakers so you can enjoy superior audio in any room.
Works with either Sonos S2 or Sonos S1 (for Android and iOS).
Connect your favorite bookshelf, floor-standing, in-wall, or in-ceiling speakers to Amp to stream all the music you love.
Connect a turntable, stereo, or portable audio device and play the sound on any Sonos speaker.
Use Amp and a pair of 3rd-party speakers to create two front audio channels.
Use Amp with third-party speakers to add surround sound if you already have a Sonos home theater speaker (Arc, Arc SL, Beam, or another Amp) connected to your TV.
Volume up (right)
Volume down (left)
TV
—When the TV is on, touch to toggle the sound on and off.
Music
—When the TV is off, touch to pause or restart music.
Swipe right across the touch controls to skip to the next song. 
Swipe left to go to the previous song.
Amp mounts perfectly in any electronics rack.
Place two Amps side by side in a 2U rack.
Place four Amps in a 3U rack.
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface at least 3 in / 50 mm from the TV.
Don’t block the TV’s IR sensor.
If put on a shelf, place at the front and keep 3" (minimum) clearance on all sides.
Don’t block the front of Amp so you can reach the touch controls.
Your speakers’ power rating should be at least 125W for 8 ohm speakers, and at least 200W for 4 ohm speakers. Do not connect speakers rated at less than 4 ohm.
Amp can drive speakers with nominal impedance above 4 ohms. Two pairs of 8 ohm speakers wired in parallel are also supported. Don’t wire your speakers in series because it will result in poor sound quality.
If your TV has an HDMI ARC port, connect the HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI ARC port.
If your TV doesn’t have an HDMI ARC port, you'll need the optical adapter. Attach it to the HDMI cable and connect the optical adapter end to your TV’s optical digital OUT port.

Connect the power cable to Arc Ultra and plug it in to power.
Note:
 Use only the included power cable (using a third-party power cord will void your warranty).
Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to your TV:
1.
 Remove the protective cap from the optical adapter, then attach the optical adapter to the HDMI cable.
2.
 Connect the optical adapter to your TV’s optical digital OUT port.
Note
: Make sure the optical adapter aligns correctly into the port before securely plugging it in. Inserting the adapter incorrectly may damage the adapter.
Use the Sonos Arc Ultra Wall Mount (sold separately) to mount Arc Ultra to the wall below (recommended) or above your TV. Sonos recommends:

Use the wall mount bracket to mark screw locations. Align the top edge with the bottom of your TV. There should be 5.5 in (14 cm) between the top of the wall mount bracket and the TV.
Mark the screw locations and remove the wall mount bracket for now.
If you’re using the included wall anchors, use a 5/16 in / 8 mm drill bit to drill the pilot holes and then insert the wall anchors. Don’t use the anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic.
Position the wall mount bracket over the marked screw locations, using a level to confirm accuracy. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a power drill to screw the bracket to the wall, making sure the arrows in the center are pointing up.
Screw the 2 knobs (thumb screws) into the back of the soundbar until they are fully tightened.
Connect the power and HDMI cables to the back of the soundbar.
Note
: If you’re connecting the cables to the TV at this time, be sure to plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV.
Slide the soundbar down so the knobs fit into the slots on the wall bracket. Make sure the touch controls are facing up and the soundbar is fully seated.
Start with Arc Ultra and expand your system over time with Sonos speakers that easily connect over WiFi.

Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.
Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in

Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)

For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked.

When the microphone light is on, voice control is on and your voice service is ready to respond.
When the light is off, voice control is off.
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface at least 2" (50 mm) from the TV.
Don’t place vertically or on its side.
Don’t block the TV’s IR sensor.
If put on a shelf, place at the front and keep 2" (minimum) clearance on both sides for best sound quality.
Keep 1" (25 mm) space (minimum) above Beam so you can reach the touch controls.
For best sound quality, keep both ends of Beam at least 1" (30 mm) from a wall or other obstruction.
Disconnect existing home theater or surround sound equipment from your TV.
Connect any external devices, like a cable box or DVD player, directly to your TV.
Turn your TV on.
If your TV has an HDMI ARC (or eARC) port
, connect the HDMI cable to it. 
(HDMI ARC is a special port that looks like a standard HDMI port—it may be on the back or side of your TV. The ports look similar, but the ARC port will be labeled ARC, eARC, or ARC/eARC. If you connect Sonos Beam to a standard HDMI port instead, you won’t hear any sound.)
If your TV doesn’t have an HDMI ARC or eARC port
, you'll need to use the optical adapter: 
Remove the protective cap from the optical adapter, then attach the optical adapter to the HDMI cable. 
Connect the optical adapter to your TV’s optical digital OUT port. 
(The TV's optical adapter’s port is “D-shaped”—make sure the connector aligns correctly into the port. Inserting the adapter incorrectly may damage the cable.)

Sonos products work together seamlessly. It’s easy to add speakers and expand your system as your home changes.
The perfect wireless speaker for any room in your home. You can even stereo pair two speakers (same model) in a room—turn each one into separate left and right channels for wider, bigger, and deeper sound.
Convert existing speakers, stereos, and home theater into music streaming systems with an amplifier.
Sonos gives you easy access to all the content you love—play the latest music from your favorite artist on Spotify, a local news radio station, and much more.
Listen in any room or every room—play a movie in the living room, a podcast in the kitchen, or group two or more speakers together so they play the same audio. If you have a home theater set up, you can send the TV sound to other speakers, too.Sonos system

Ethernet ports
Use an Ethernet cable to connect to a router, computer, or additional network device like a network-attached storage (NAS) device (optional).
LED indicators:
Flashing Green (network activity)
Yellow (link connection)
12V trigger
Use a stereo cable or a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable to wake your third-party amplifier whenever Sonos starts playing audio.
Note
: Read the guide that came with your amplifier for details on the use of 12V trigger input.
AC power (Mains) input
Use only the included power supply (using a third-party power supply will void your warranty).
Analog audio in
Use a standard RCA audio cable (included) to connect Port’s analog audio inputs to the audio outputs on another device, like a pre-amplified turntable.
Analog audio out
Use a standard RCA audio cable (included) to connect Port’s analog audio outputs to the audio inputs on your amplified audio component.
Digital audio out
Use a digital coaxial cable to connect Port’s coaxial digital audio output to the audio inputs on your amplified audio component.
You can place Port just about anywhere—in an electronics rack, on a shelf, or on a credenza with your audio/video receiver (AVR).
Rack mounted
Port fits perfectly in any electronics rack using a third-party shelf. You can fit 3 units across a standard rack and take up only 1 rack unit of vertical space.
Placed on a credenza
Connect the power cord and plug in your Port.
 
Connect Port to your audio equipment.  
For powered speakers:
For an audio/video receiver (AVR) or amplifier:
For a computer:
 
Download the app from the app store on your mobile device if you don't already have it. You’ll use it to set up and control your Sonos system.
 
Connect an audio device, like a projector, CD player, or turntable (with a built-in phono preamp), to any Sonos product that has a line-in port (Era 300, Era 100, Amp, Port, or Five). Then go to 
 > 
Line-In 
to select the source and start playback.
Note
: Era 300 and Era 100 require a Sonos Line-In or Combo Adapter (
sold separately
). Other products may require a different type of line-in adapter depending on your audio source.      
Learn more
Control volume from your AVR or amplifier (Fixed line-out level)
Set Port’s line-out level to 
Fixed
 if you want to control the volume exclusively from your AVR or amplifier. You won’t be able to use the Sonos app to adjust the volume or equalization settings.
Control the volume from Sonos (Variable line-out level)
When Port’s line-out level is set to 
Variable
, you can use the Sonos app to adjust the volume.
Use Sonos to control the volume on your home theater or amplifier
When Port’s line-out level is set to 
Pass-Through
, Port stays at a fixed volume and sends volume commands to your amplifier. You can control volume using the Sonos app, a universal remote, or your voice if you have a voice assistant enabled.
Note
: Make sure your amplifier supports Pass-Through. If you set the line-out level to Pass-Through and your amplifier doesn’t support it, you won’t be able to control the volume.
Port plays audio in stereo by default. You can change the sound settings for the room associated with the Port so it plays in two mono channels when playing music.

See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add Port to your Sonos system
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface.
If you put it on a shelf, for best performance place it at the front and leave at least 2" space all around.
You may need a Y-adapter audio cable (one 1/8" stereo miniplug to dual RCA male connectors) to connect powered speakers to the audio outputs on the Sonos product. 
If your speakers have a male 1/8" stereo plug, you’ll need to attach a female-to-female coupler between the speaker plug and the Y-adapter audio cable.
If you have digital inputs on your AVR or amplifier, you can use a digital coaxial cable to connect Port’s digital output to the digital input on the receiver.
If you have analog inputs on your AVR or amplifier, use a standard RCA audio cable to connect Port’s analog audio output to the audio inputs on the receiver.
Select the proper input channel on the receiver. See 
Control volume from your AVR or amplifier
 to adjust volume settings.
You’ll need a stereo mini to RCA Y-adapter audio cable (one 1/8" stereo miniplug to dual RCA male connectors) to connect from Port’s analog audio output to your computer’s audio input.

If the light is distracting, you can turn it off in your room’s settings.
Join button
Press to connect during setup.
Ethernet port
Use an Ethernet cable if you want to connect to a router (optional).
AC power (mains) input
Use only the supplied power cord to connect to a power outlet (using a third party power cord will void your warranty). Be sure to use the proper power adapter for your country. Push the power cord firmly into Sub until it is flush with the surface.
Choose a location—Sub is designed to provide optimal sound wherever you place it.
Attach the power cord and plug in Sub. Be sure to push the power cord firmly into Sub until it is flush with the surface.
 
Download the Sonos app from the app store if you don't already have it. You’ll use it to set up and control your Sonos system. See 
Setup
 for more information. 
Note
: Make sure you set up at least one compatible speaker before adding Sub.
 
Note
: After Sub is paired with a Sonos speaker, you won’t see it displayed separately in your system. Any changes you make to the speaker it's paired with, like volume, mute, or music selection, will also affect Sub.
If you’re placing Sub horizontally on a floor, you can attach permanent felt feet               (
purchased separately
) to protect your floor. If you’re putting it on a rug or using it vertically, no need to adhere the felt feet. 
Note:
 The felt feet are not removable—a strong adhesive will keep them permanently attached to Sub.
To adjust Sub's settings, go to 
 > System and select your Sub.

Use the slider to increase or decrease volume. (You can use this setting to match the subwoofer level to the level of your main speakers.)
Phase control
Choose 0° or 180° to set the phase control for your Sonos Sub or third-party subwoofer (flip if you don't hear enough bass in your usual listening position).
When a room with a Sonos Sub is tuned using Trueplay, phase control is set and can't be changed unless you disable Trueplay.
Reset
Resets all Sub audio settings to their default values (0).
You can easily change the Sonos speaker your sub is paired with. 
If you’re moving it to a new room, wait for the status light to stop flashing after you plug the sub back in.
You can easily connect a second Sub to your Sonos system. 
Note
: At least one Sub must be a Sub (Gen 3). If the button on the side is round instead of square, it's a Sub (Gen 3). You cannot pair a Sub Mini with a Sub.

Instantly adds a dimension of deep bass impact to your audio listening experience.
Allows placement anywhere because it’s wireless and compact—position it vertically or horizontally on any floor surface.
The top of the acoustic slot doubles as a handle so you can lift it.
Sub (Gen. 3) is compatible with the Sonos 
S2 app
  (for Android and iOS). Earlier Sub models are compatible with either 
S1
 or S2.
Sonos Sub is designed for use with most Sonos speakers, except Sonos Roam, Roam SL, Connect, Port, and Move. Make sure you set up at least one speaker before adding Sub.
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add a Sub to your Sonos system.
Use the acoustic slot as a handle to lift Sub out of the box. You should always bend your knees when lifting heavy objects to avoid undue stress on your back.
Make sure at least one side of the slot is free from obstruction. If you place it vertically against a wall, don’t block the front opening. 
If you place Sub horizontally on the floor, don’t put anything on top of it. Leave at least 1" clearance along the top of Sub if placing under furniture.
Sub is designed to sit on the floor. You can place it in a corner, against the wall, behind, under, or next to any piece of furniture on any kind of floor surface.
Position Sub either vertically or horizontally. If you’re going to use it horizontally, you can attach permanent felt feet. See 
Attach feet
  (optional) for more information.

Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.

If your TV is wall-mounted, place the positioning guide against the wall, aligning the top edge with the bottom of your TV. There should be 5.5" (140mm) between the top of the wall mount bracket and the TV.
Mark the screw locations and remove the guide. 
If you’re using the included wall anchors, use a 5/16" drill bit to drill the pilot holes and then insert the wall anchors. Don’t use the anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic.
Position the wall mount bracket over the marked screw locations, using a level to confirm accuracy. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a power drill to screw the bracket to the wall, making sure the arrows in the center are pointing up.
Screw the 2 knobs into the back of the soundbar until they are fully tightened.
Connect the power and HDMI cables to the back of the soundbar.
Note
: If you’re connecting the cables to the TV at this time, be sure to plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV.
Slide the soundbar down so the knobs fit into the slots on the wall bracket. Make sure the touch controls are facing up and the soundbar is fully seated.

When the microphone light is on, voice control is on and your voice service is ready to respond.
When the light is off, voice control is off.
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface.
Keep 4" (102mm) space (minimum) between the top of the soundbar and the bottom of your TV (if placing soundbar below the TV).
Don't place vertically or on its side.
Make sure the touch controls are facing up.
Disconnect existing home theater or surround sound equipment from your TV.
Connect any external devices, like a cable box or DVD player, directly to your TV.
Turn your TV on.
If your TV has an HDMI ARC (or eARC) port
, connect the HDMI cable to it.
(HDMI ARC is a special port that looks like a standard HDMI port—it may be on the back or side of your TV. The ports look similar, but the ARC port will be labeled ARC, eARC, or ARC/eARC. If you connect the Sonos soundbar to a standard HDMI port instead, you won’t hear any sound).
If your TV doesn’t have an HDMI ARC or eARC port
, you'll need to use the optical adapter:
Remove the protective cap from the optical adapter, then attach the optical adapter to the HDMI cable.
Connect the optical adapter to your TV’s optical digital OUT port.
(The TV's optical adapter’s port is “D-shaped”—make sure the connector aligns correctly into the port. Inserting the adapter incorrectly may damage the cable).
Sonos Voice Control
: control your whole Sonos system with hands-free ease and unmatched privacy. Sonos Voice Control comes ready to use—it only takes a few seconds to add when you set up your speakers. 
More information

: you’ll need the Sonos app and the Alexa app with the Sonos skill enabled. You’ll make some changes in both apps during setup.

Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port. 
Use the Sonos Arc wall mount kit (sold separately on 
www.sonos.com
). Follow the instructions in the kit.
Keep 4.0" (102 mm) space (minimum) between Arc/Arc SL and your TV.
Make sure the touch controls are facing up.
For best sound quality, keep both ends of the soundbar at least 1' (30cm) from a wall or other obstructions.

It’s easy to turn two Sonos speakers (same model), or a Sonos Amp and your favorite non-Sonos speakers, into separate right and left channels for your home theater. 
Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.
Learn more
 
During setup, surround sound is optimized for your room. These settings are adjustable:
Surrounds
Turn surround sound 
On
 or 
Off
.
TV Level
Adjust surround volume for TV audio.
Music Level
Adjust surround volume for music.
Music Playback
Ambient
 (subtle) or 
Full
 (louder, full range). Doesn't apply to Dolby Atmos Music playback.
Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.
Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in 
Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked. 
Learn more
Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter
 using the Ethernet cable.
EQ
Sonos products ship with preset equalization settings. You can change the sound settings (bass, treble, or loudness) to suit your personal preferences.

Touch Controls
You can disable the touch control on your speaker. You may want to do this to prevent a child or curious pet from accidentally adjusting playback or volume.

Battery Saver 
(portable products only)

If your TV is wall-mounted, align the top edge of the bracket with the bottom of your TV, leaving at least 2.5 inches (mm) between them.
Mark the screw locations and remove the bracket.
If you’re using wall anchors, use a 5/16" drill bit to drill pilot holes, starting with the hole on the left. Then insert the wall anchors. Don’t use wall anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic. See 
Wall mounting information
.
Position the wall mount bracket over the screw locations, using a level to confirm accuracy. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a power drill to screw the bracket to the wall, making sure the center notch is pointing up.
Using a Phillips head screwdriver, fasten the 2 attachment screws to the back of the soundbar, making sure they are fully tightened.

Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.
Learn more
It’s easy to turn two Sonos speakers (same model), or a Sonos Amp and your favorite non-Sonos speakers, into separate right and left channels for your home theater. 
Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.
Learn more

 > 
Line-In

Note
: Era 300 and Era 100 require a Sonos Line-In or Combo Adapter (

Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)

For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked. 
Learn more
Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a

Versatile design with smart orientation sensing. Pair two speakers horizontally and Five automatically separates the left and right channels for impressive stereo sound. When paired vertically, each smartly adjusts to mono for more detailed stereo separation and an even wider soundstage.
Touch controls on the speaker let you adjust volume, play and pause, or skip through songs.
Use the 
line-in
 port to connect your turntable or another device—simple control with the Sonos app or Apple AirPlay 2.
Pair two Fives for left-right 
stereo sound
 or use two Fives as rear 
surrounds
 for your home theater.
Control your Sonos system with the 
Sonos app
 (for Android and iOS).
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add Five to your Sonos system.
Volume up (right)
Volume down (left)
Press once to play or pause audio.
Press and hold to add the audio that's playing in another room.
Swipe right to skip to the next song.
Swipe left to go to the previous song.
Five is a substantial and powerful speaker and should be placed on a flat surface that is robust and durable enough to properly support it. Make sure Five’s rubber feet sit completely on the flat surface.
Allow at least 2" perimeter all around Five, including its power cord.
For a single Five speaker, we recommend positioning the speaker horizontally to enable stereo sound.
Place Five across the room from where you’ll be listening (at or close to your ear height for best results).
For stereo pair placement information, see 
Set up stereo pair
.
Five is humidity resistant so you can use it in the bathroom; however it is not water resistant, so don’t position it near water or leave it outside during a rain storm.
Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port.

The USB-C port is designed for line-in and Ethernet connections using the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter (sold separately). It's not a power source for the speaker and shouldn't be used to charge other devices.
Trueplay tuning will adjust the sound for wherever you place Sonos Era 300, but for the speaker to project sound most effectively, here are a few guidelines:
Note
: Don’t position Era 300 vertically or at a steep angle or the audio will stop.
Connect two rear Era 300s to a compatible Sonos soundbar for immersive for surround sound. 
Connect an audio device, like a projector, CD player, or turntable (with a built-in phono preamp), to any Sonos product that has a line-in port (Era 300, Era 100, Amp, Port, or Five). Then go to 
 > 
Line-In 
to select the source and start playback.
Note
: Era 300 and Era 100 require a Sonos Line-In or Combo Adapter (
sold separately
). Other products may require a different type of line-in adapter depending on your audio source.

There are two ways to control the microphones on Era 300: 
A universal microphone switch on the back turns all microphones on and off.
A voice services button on top turns voice services on and off without affecting the microphones needed for Trueplay and other microphone-enabled features. 
Use your voice to control your Sonos system with any voice-enabled Sonos product—play and control content, turn the volume up or down, and more.
Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you place it.
During setup, choose the Trueplay option that works best for you and your space. To retune later, go to 
 > 
System
, choose a room, and select 
Trueplay
. 
Advanced tuning is custom and precise. It takes about 5 minutes and uses the microphone on an iOS device (running iOS 8 or later) so you'll move around the room while the sound is fine tuned for your space. 
Note
: Advanced tuning is the best choice for large rooms (open concept spaces may experience less precise tuning).
Quick tuning is fast, effortless, and accessible. It takes about a minute and uses the microphone on your Sonos product to detect the environment so there's no need to move around the room during tuning. 
Note
: Quick tuning is available for both iOS and Android, and is a good choice for smaller rooms, or spaces where it's difficult to move easily. 
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.
Learn more
It’s easy to turn two Sonos Era 300 speakers into separate right and left channels for your home theater. With Era 300, the sound is sent in all directions so locating a sweet spot in the room is not necessary.
Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.

During setup, surround sound is optimized for your room. These settings are adjustable:

Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked. 
Learn more
Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter
 using the Ethernet cable.
EQ
Sonos products ship with preset equalization settings. You can change the sound settings (bass, treble, or loudness) to suit your personal preferences.

Trueplay
Trueplay adapts the sound for your surroundings and content. Portable products can tune themselves automatically.

Volume Limit
You can set a maximum volume for each room.

Status Light
Displays the speaker’s connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors.

Note
: If the light is distracting, you can turn it off in 
Settings
.
Touch Controls
You can disable the touch control on your speaker. You may want to do this to prevent a child or curious pet from accidentally adjusting playback or volume.

Battery Saver 
(portable products only)
To save battery life, you can set your portable speaker to power off automatically instead of going to sleep. It won't appear in the Sonos app until it’s powered back on.

Note
: Sonos speakers sold separately.
Take everything out of the box and place the base in the packaging slot to stabilize it for the next few steps. Thread the end of the Sonos Era 300 power cord that attaches to the speaker through the opening in the stand base and into the pole channel.
Caution
: This stand is intended only for use with Sonos Era 300.
Position the washer with the alignment pins facing in. Then align the stand pole with the base, using the alignment pins to guide you.
Fasten the base (with the washer) to the stand pole using 1 black screw (included) and a Phillips-head screwdriver. Make sure the cord can still slide freely.
Attach the speaker platform to the bottom of the speaker using 2 screws (included).
Attach the speaker platform to the stand pole using the other screw (included). Then plug the power cord into the speaker. You may need someone to hold the speaker for this step.
Snap the pole cap onto the top of the pole to hide the power cord. Be careful not to pinch the cable. Then, working from top to bottom, neatly press the power cord into the cable channel on the pole.
Place the stand where you want it. Plug the speaker into a power outlet, then tuck the excess cord under the stand base.
Important
: This wall mount is for use only with Sonos Era 300 (sold separately), and is designed for wall stud installation.

Inverted wall mounting (upside down)
Locate a wall stud. Place the bracket against the wall using a level to make sure it’s aligned, and mark the screw holes. Remove the bracket.
Pre-drill pilot holes into a stud using a 9/64” drill bit. Place the bracket against the wall with the small arrows pointing up, and secure it to the wall with 2 long wall bracket screws (included) and a power drill or Phillips-head screwdriver.
Thread the power cord through the opening at the back of the mount and plug it into the speaker.
Rotate the speaker 180° so the screw holes are facing up. Attach the speaker platform to the speaker using 2 short speaker mount screws (included).
Align the mount with the bracket keyhole, slide the mount down, and lock it into place. Make sure the wall mount and speaker are securely seated before removing your hands from the speaker.
To adjust for optimal sound, unlock the speaker by rotating the collar on the mount 90° counterclockwise. Reposition the speaker, then rotate the collar 90° clockwise to lock.
Caution
: The mount is restricted to certain angles to give you the best possible sound quality. Do not force an adjustment beyond what is easily allowed.

Amplifier
Six Class-D digital amplifiers precision-tuned for the speaker's unique acoustic architecture.
Tweeters
Four tweeters ensure faithful playback of high and mid-range frequencies. The forward-firing mid tweeter provides a smooth center image while two side-firing mid tweeters create stereo separation. An upward-firing tweeter reflects sound off the ceiling when playing Dolby Atmos content.
Woofers
Two woofers maximize low-end output and are angled left and right to support stereo playback.

Ethernet
: Use the Sonos Combo Adapter and an Ethernet cable to connect Era 300 directly to your router if you want to hardwire your speaker (helpful if your WiFi is unstable).
Line-in
: Use either the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter to connect your turntable, CD player, projector, or other device.
Era 300 should be placed indoors and have approximately 2' (.61m) of overhead clearance for optimal sound quality. Placement in an enclosed space like a bookshelf is not recommended as this could impact dispersion and playback clarity.
If you are mounting Era 300 within 2' (.61m) of a ceiling, place it upside down for the best sound.
When Era 300 is placed next to a wall or on a shelf, leave at least 1" (2.5cm) clearance in back and 8” (20.32cm) on each side of the speaker.
Traditional stereo setups often have an ideal place to sit in a room for the best listening experience, but with Era 300 the sound is sent in all directions so you'll experience rich detail no matter where you’re seated.
Both speakers' height should be around ear level and behind your seated position.
Leave at least 8" (20.32cm) clearance around the sides of each speaker.
When both are on, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are available.
When both are off, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are unavailable.
When the universal microphone switch is on and the voice services light is off, Trueplay and other microphone-enabled features are available but voice control is off.
