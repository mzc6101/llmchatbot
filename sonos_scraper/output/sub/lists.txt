Pulse-pounding bass. 
Dual Sonos-engineered drivers generate deep, dynamic low frequencies. The ported enclosure enhances the bass response so you feel every beat, roar, and rumble in your chest.
Transform your home theater experience. 
Pair Sub 4 with Sonos Arc, or Beam for dramatically deeper bass and clearer highs that draw you deeper into movies, shows, and games.
Bring your music to life.
 Hear the nuance in every note and enjoy a greater sense of spaciousness when you pair Sub 4 with Sonos Five, Era 300, or Era 100.
Iconic design.
 With its elegant sculptural shape and updated matte finish, Sub 4 is designed to look great in your home and to match your Sonos speakers.
Place it where and how you want.
 Sub 4 reliably connects to your Sonos soundbar or speaker over WiFi so you can place it anywhere in the room—even on its side and under your sofa.
Use the acoustic slot as a handle to lift Sub 4 out of the box. You should always bend your knees when lifting heavy objects to avoid undue stress on your back.
Make sure at least one side of the slot is free from obstruction. If you place it vertically against a wall, don’t block the front opening. 
If you place Sub 4 horizontally on the floor, don’t put anything on top of it. Leave at least 1" clearance along the top of Sub 4 if placing under furniture.
Sub 4 is designed to sit on the floor. You can place it in a corner, against the wall, behind, under, or next to any piece of furniture on any kind of floor surface.
Position Sub 4 either vertically or horizontally. If you’re going to use it horizontally, you can attach permanent felt feet.
