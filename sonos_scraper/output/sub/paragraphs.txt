Acoustic slot
You can use the acoustic slot as a handle to lift Sub 4.
Status light
Displays the product's connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors. 
Learn more
If the light is distracting, you can turn it off in your room’s settings.
Join button
Press to connect during setup.
Ethernet port
Use an Ethernet cable if you want to connect to a router (optional).
AC power (mains) input
Use only the supplied power cord to connect to a power outlet (using a third party power cord will void your warranty). Be sure to use the proper power adapter for your country. Push the power cord firmly into Sub 4 until it is flush with the surface.
Choose a location—Sub 4 is designed to provide optimal sound wherever you place it.
Note
: Make sure you set up at least one compatible speaker before adding Sub 4.
Use the Sonos app to adjust 
Sub Audio
 settings:
Sub
Toggle 
On 
or 
Off
 to turn the sound from Sub on and off.
Sub Level
Use the slider to increase or decrease volume. (You can use this setting to match the Sub level to the level of your main speakers.)
Phase Control
Choose 0° or 180° to set the phase control for your Sonos Sub or third-party subwoofer (flip if you don't hear enough bass in your usual listening position).
When a room with a Sonos Sub is tuned using Trueplay, phase control is set and can't be changed unless you disable Trueplay.
Reset
Resets all Sub audio settings to their default values (0).
You can easily change the Sonos speaker your Sub 4 is paired with. 
Note
: If you unplug your Sub from power and plug it back in somewhere else, wait for the status light to stop flashing and turn solid white before changing its settings.
You can pair the Sub 4 with a different Sonos product or choose not to use it right now. It will appear as "unused" in your list of products until you pair it with another Sonos speaker.
Connect a second Sonos subwoofer to your home theater setup for even deeper, room-filling bass. 
In the Sonos app:
Before you start, make sure your subwoofers are compatible with a dual subwoofer home theater setup.
