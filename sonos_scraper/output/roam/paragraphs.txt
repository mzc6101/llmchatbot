Use your voice to control your Sonos system with any voice-enabled Sonos product—play and control content, turn the volume up or down, and more.
Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.

Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
