Versatile design with smart orientation sensing. Pair two speakers horizontally and Five automatically separates the left and right channels for impressive stereo sound. When paired vertically, each smartly adjusts to mono for more detailed stereo separation and an even wider soundstage.
Touch controls on the speaker let you adjust volume, play and pause, or skip through songs.
Use the 
line-in
 port to connect your turntable or another device—simple control with the Sonos app or Apple AirPlay 2.
Pair two Fives for left-right 
stereo sound
 or use two Fives as rear 
surrounds
 for your home theater.
Control your Sonos system with the 
Sonos app
 (for Android and iOS).
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add Five to your Sonos system.
Volume up (right)
Volume down (left)
Press once to play or pause audio.
Press and hold to add the audio that's playing in another room.
Swipe right to skip to the next song.
Swipe left to go to the previous song.
Five is a substantial and powerful speaker and should be placed on a flat surface that is robust and durable enough to properly support it. Make sure Five’s rubber feet sit completely on the flat surface.
Allow at least 2" perimeter all around Five, including its power cord.
For a single Five speaker, we recommend positioning the speaker horizontally to enable stereo sound.
Place Five across the room from where you’ll be listening (at or close to your ear height for best results).
For stereo pair placement information, see 
Set up stereo pair
.
Five is humidity resistant so you can use it in the bathroom; however it is not water resistant, so don’t position it near water or leave it outside during a rain storm.
Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port.
