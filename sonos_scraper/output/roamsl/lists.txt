You can place the speaker next to a wall or on a shelf—for best performance, leave at least 1" (2.5cm) space around the back of the speaker.
The speaker’s durable design includes silicone end caps to protect from drops or bumps.
Avoid placing the speaker in direct sunlight.
You can place Sonos Roam SL horizontally or vertically. When vertical, the speaker takes up barely any room. Position it horizontally for added stability on uneven surfaces.
Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port.
