Next-level immersion.
 With an all-new acoustic architecture powered by 14 Sonos-engineered drivers and advanced technologies like Sound Motion, Arc Ultra fills every inch of the room and precisely places sounds all around you.
The only soundbar with Sound Motion. 
One of the most significant breakthroughs in audio engineering in nearly 100 years, Sound Motion allows Arc Ultra to pack unprecedentedly clear, deep, and balanced sound into an unbelievably sleek design.
Experience Dolby Atmos like never before. 
Dolby Atmos takes your entertainment to another dimension, enveloping you in a 9.1.4 spatial audio experience. Add a Sonos Sub and Era 300 rear speakers for unparalleled surround sound, with bass you can feel and jaw-dropping detail from every direction.
Ultra-clear dialogue.
 Arc Ultra maximizes center channel performance for vocal clarity so you never miss a word. Make dialogue even clearer by choosing your preferred level of 
Speech Enhancement
 in the 
Sonos app.
Effortless setup and control. 
Just plug in the power cable, connect your TV with the included HDMI cable, and open the Sonos app to complete setup. Control with your TV remote, the Sonos app, the touch controls, Sonos Voice Control, and Amazon Alexa.
