Here are some recommendations to get the most out of your Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar:
When your soundbar is securely where you want it, use the included cables to set up your Arc Ultra. 
Connect the power cable to Arc Ultra and plug it in to power.
Note:
 Use only the included power cable (using a third-party power cord will void your warranty).
Connect the other end of the HDMI cable to your TV:
1.
 Remove the protective cap from the optical adapter, then attach the optical adapter to the HDMI cable.
2.
 Connect the optical adapter to your TV’s optical digital OUT port.
Note
: Make sure the optical adapter aligns correctly into the port before securely plugging it in. Inserting the adapter incorrectly may damage the adapter.
Use the Sonos Arc Ultra Wall Mount (sold separately) to mount Arc Ultra to the wall below (recommended) or above your TV. Sonos recommends:

Use the wall mount bracket to mark screw locations. Align the top edge with the bottom of your TV. There should be 5.5 in (14 cm) between the top of the wall mount bracket and the TV.
Mark the screw locations and remove the wall mount bracket for now.
If you’re using the included wall anchors, use a 5/16 in / 8 mm drill bit to drill the pilot holes and then insert the wall anchors. Don’t use the anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic.
Position the wall mount bracket over the marked screw locations, using a level to confirm accuracy. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a power drill to screw the bracket to the wall, making sure the arrows in the center are pointing up.
Screw the 2 knobs (thumb screws) into the back of the soundbar until they are fully tightened.
Connect the power and HDMI cables to the back of the soundbar.
Note
: If you’re connecting the cables to the TV at this time, be sure to plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV.
Slide the soundbar down so the knobs fit into the slots on the wall bracket. Make sure the touch controls are facing up and the soundbar is fully seated.
Start with Arc Ultra and expand your system over time with Sonos speakers that easily connect over WiFi.
