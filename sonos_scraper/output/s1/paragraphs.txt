This original Sonos app can be downloaded on your mobile device to control your older products. Products released after May 2020 aren’t compatible with the S1 Controller app. If you have both older and newer products, you can unplug your older products, or upgrade them; or you can create two separate systems—one running S2 with products that are S2 compatible and another running S1 with products that are not.
