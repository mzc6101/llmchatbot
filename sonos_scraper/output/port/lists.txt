Plug in the audio equipment you already own and listen out loud.
Stream everything you love using the Sonos app and Apple AirPlay2.
Use line-in to connect your turntable, or play music straight from a friend’s phone on your stereo.
12V trigger automatically turns your amplifier on and off.
Works with either the 
Sonos S2
 or 
Sonos S1
 app (for Android and iOS).
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add Port to your Sonos system
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface.
If you put it on a shelf, for best performance place it at the front and leave at least 2" space all around.
You may need a Y-adapter audio cable (one 1/8" stereo miniplug to dual RCA male connectors) to connect powered speakers to the audio outputs on the Sonos product. 
If your speakers have a male 1/8" stereo plug, you’ll need to attach a female-to-female coupler between the speaker plug and the Y-adapter audio cable.
If you have digital inputs on your AVR or amplifier, you can use a digital coaxial cable to connect Port’s digital output to the digital input on the receiver.
If you have analog inputs on your AVR or amplifier, use a standard RCA audio cable to connect Port’s analog audio output to the audio inputs on the receiver.
Select the proper input channel on the receiver. See 
Control volume from your AVR or amplifier
 to adjust volume settings.
You’ll need a stereo mini to RCA Y-adapter audio cable (one 1/8" stereo miniplug to dual RCA male connectors) to connect from Port’s analog audio output to your computer’s audio input.
