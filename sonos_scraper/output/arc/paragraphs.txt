Every room is different. Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you've placed it.
Trueplay works on iOS mobile devices running iOS 8 or later. During tuning, you'll move around the room holding your mobile device.
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.
Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in 
Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked.

Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter

When a projector, turntable, stereo, or other audio device is connected to a Sonos product, you can adjust these line-in settings: 
Sonos products for your TV provide full-theater sound and play music too. Create a home theater system by adding a pair of 
rear surrounds
 and a

If your TV is wall-mounted, place the positioning guide against the wall, aligning the top edge with the bottom of your TV. There should be 5.5" (140mm) between the top of the wall mount bracket and the TV.
Mark the screw locations and remove the guide. 
If you’re using the included wall anchors, use a 5/16" drill bit to drill the pilot holes and then insert the wall anchors. Don’t use the anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic.
Position the wall mount bracket over the marked screw locations, using a level to confirm accuracy. Use a Phillips-head screwdriver or a power drill to screw the bracket to the wall, making sure the arrows in the center are pointing up.
Screw the 2 knobs into the back of the soundbar until they are fully tightened.
Connect the power and HDMI cables to the back of the soundbar.
Note
: If you’re connecting the cables to the TV at this time, be sure to plug the HDMI cable into the HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV.
Slide the soundbar down so the knobs fit into the slots on the wall bracket. Make sure the touch controls are facing up and the soundbar is fully seated.
