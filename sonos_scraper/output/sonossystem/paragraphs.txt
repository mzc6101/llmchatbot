Sonos products work together seamlessly. It’s easy to add speakers and expand your system as your home changes.
The perfect wireless speaker for any room in your home. You can even stereo pair two speakers (same model) in a room—turn each one into separate left and right channels for wider, bigger, and deeper sound.
Convert existing speakers, stereos, and home theater into music streaming systems with an amplifier.
Sonos gives you easy access to all the content you love—play the latest music from your favorite artist on Spotify, a local news radio station, and much more.
Listen in any room or every room—play a movie in the living room, a podcast in the kitchen, or group two or more speakers together so they play the same audio. If you have a home theater set up, you can send the TV sound to other speakers, too.
