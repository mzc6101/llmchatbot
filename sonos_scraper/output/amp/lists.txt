Amp features a built-in state-of-the-art digital amplifier that can power large or small speakers so you can enjoy superior audio in any room.
Works with either Sonos S2 or Sonos S1 (for Android and iOS).
Connect your favorite bookshelf, floor-standing, in-wall, or in-ceiling speakers to Amp to stream all the music you love.
Connect a turntable, stereo, or portable audio device and play the sound on any Sonos speaker.
Use Amp and a pair of 3rd-party speakers to create two front audio channels.
Use Amp with third-party speakers to add surround sound if you already have a Sonos home theater speaker (Arc, Arc SL, Beam, or another Amp) connected to your TV.
Volume up (right)
Volume down (left)
TV
—When the TV is on, touch to toggle the sound on and off.
Music
—When the TV is off, touch to pause or restart music.
Swipe right across the touch controls to skip to the next song. 
Swipe left to go to the previous song.
Amp mounts perfectly in any electronics rack.
Place two Amps side by side in a 2U rack.
Place four Amps in a 3U rack.
Place horizontally on a stable and level surface at least 3 in / 50 mm from the TV.
Don’t block the TV’s IR sensor.
If put on a shelf, place at the front and keep 3" (minimum) clearance on all sides.
Don’t block the front of Amp so you can reach the touch controls.
Your speakers’ power rating should be at least 125W for 8 ohm speakers, and at least 200W for 4 ohm speakers. Do not connect speakers rated at less than 4 ohm.
Amp can drive speakers with nominal impedance above 4 ohms. Two pairs of 8 ohm speakers wired in parallel are also supported. Don’t wire your speakers in series because it will result in poor sound quality.
If your TV has an HDMI ARC port, connect the HDMI cable to your TV’s HDMI ARC port.
If your TV doesn’t have an HDMI ARC port, you'll need the optical adapter. Attach it to the HDMI cable and connect the optical adapter end to your TV’s optical digital OUT port.
