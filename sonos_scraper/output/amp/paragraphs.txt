Power your passive speakers, create your dream smart home, and enjoy endless possibilities for multiroom listening.
Play music through your favorite speakers
Enhance your TV sound
Connect Amp to your TV to create the ultimate entertainment system.
(For even deeper sound, add a Sonos Sub or connect a third-party subwoofer.)
See 
Setup
 when you’re ready to add Amp to your Sonos system.
Status light
Displays the product's connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors.

Volume control
Touch and hold to quickly change the volume.
Play/Pause
Touch to play or pause sound.
Next/Previous
(Music only)
Note
: You can’t skip forward or go back when listening to a radio station.
HDMI ARC
Use an HDMI cable to connect Amp to your TV’s HDMI ARC port.
Ethernet ports
Use an Ethernet cable if you want to connect to a router, computer, or network-attached storage (NAS) device (optional).
Join button
Press to connect during setup.
AC power (Mains) port
Use only the supplied power cord (using a third-party power cord will void your warranty).
Note
: Insert the power cord firmly.
Analog audio in
Use a standard RCA audio cable (included) to connect Amp's analog audio inputs to the outputs on another device, like a pre-amplified turntable or portable music player.
Subwoofer output
Connect a powered subwoofer to this output using a standard RCA cable. The system will detect when a cable is connected to the subwoofer output and adjust the crossover frequency automatically.
Note
: If you disconnect your subwoofer, make sure to also disconnect the subwoofer’s cable from the Amp output.
Speaker terminals
Use high-quality speaker wire to connect your speakers to Amp.
You can place Amp just about anywhere—in an electronics rack, on a shelf, or on a credenza with your TV.
Rack mounted
Placed on a credenza
Make sure your speakers are compatible with Amp:
Remove the cap from the banana plug to reveal the connection hole.
Insert the stripped end of the speaker wire into the hole, then put the cap back on the banana plug to secure the connection.
Note
: Connect the red (+) and black (-) terminals from each speaker to the corresponding banana plugs and terminals on Amp. Mismatching of polarities will result in weak central sound and a distorted sense of sound direction.
Insert the banana plug into the proper speaker terminal on the back of Amp.
Repeat to install the other speaker wires.
Connect the power cord and plug in Amp.
If you're connecting Amp to your TV, use an HDMI cable to connect from Amp's 's HDMI port to your TV.  
When connected, Amp creates two front audio channels and plays your TV sound through your favorite non-Sonos speakers.
Connect an audio device, like a projector, CD player, or turntable (with a built-in phono preamp), to any Sonos product that has a line-in port (Era 300, Era 100, Amp, Port, or Five). Then go to 
 > 
Line-In 
to select the source and start playback.
Note
: Era 300 and Era 100 require a Sonos Line-In or Combo Adapter (
sold separately
). Other products may require a different type of line-in adapter depending on your audio source.

Amp plays audio in stereo by default. You can change the sound settings for the room associated with the Port so it plays in two mono channels when playing music.
