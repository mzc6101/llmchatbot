Bluetooth button
USB-C port
The USB-C port is designed for line-in and Ethernet connections using the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter (sold separately). It's not a power source for the speaker and shouldn't be used to charge other devices.
Universal microphone switch 
Toggle to turn all product microphones on or off.
Note
: To use voice services, both the microphone switch and the voice services indicator light must be on.
You can put your speaker just about anywhere. For the best performance, here's a few guidelines: 
Connect an audio device, like a projector, CD player, or turntable (with a built-in phono preamp), to any Sonos product that has a line-in port (Era 300, Era 100, Amp, Port, or Five). Then go to 
 > 
Line-In 
to select the source and start playback.
Note
: Era 300 and Era 100 require a Sonos Line-In or Combo Adapter (
sold separately
). Other products may require a different type of line-in adapter depending on your audio source.

There are two ways to control the microphones on Era 100: 
A universal microphone switch on the back of Era 100 turns all microphones on and off.
A voice services button on top of Era 100 turns voice services on and off without affecting the microphones needed for Trueplay and other microphone-dependent features. 
Use your voice to control your Sonos system with any voice-enabled Sonos product—play and control content, turn the volume up or down, and more.
Note
: Voice control isn’t supported in every country yet—this feature will be available as soon as Sonos and a voice service launch together in your region.
Trueplay tuning measures how sound reflects off walls, furnishings, and other surfaces in a room, then fine tunes your Sonos speaker to make sure it sounds great no matter where you place it.
During setup, choose the Trueplay option that works best for you and your space. To retune later, go to 
 > 
System
, choose a room, and select 
Trueplay
. 
Advanced tuning is custom and precise. It takes about 5 minutes and uses the microphone on an iOS device (running iOS 8 or later) so you'll move around the room while the sound is fine tuned for your space. 
Note
: Advanced tuning is the best choice for large rooms (open concept spaces may experience less precise tuning).
Quick tuning is fast, effortless, and accessible. It takes about a minute and uses the microphone on your Sonos product to detect the environment so there's no need to move around the room during tuning. 
Note
: Quick tuning is available for both iOS and Android, and is a good choice for smaller rooms, or spaces where it's difficult to move easily. 
Portable Sonos products like Sonos Roam and Move can tune themselves automatically. Auto Trueplay uses your speaker’s microphone to detect the environment and make periodic tuning adjustments so you get great sound wherever your speaker is and whatever you're listening to. 
Go to 
 > 
System
, and select your portable speaker to turn on auto Trueplay.
Pair two Sonos speakers in the same room for an even wider, stereo experience. One speaker serves as the left channel and one serves as the right channel. 
Note
: The Sonos speakers in a stereo pair must be the same type.
Learn more
It’s easy to turn two Sonos speakers (same model), or a Sonos Amp and your favorite non-Sonos speakers, into separate right and left channels for your home theater. 
Note
: If you group the rooms or create a stereo pair instead, you won't have surround sound.

During setup, surround sound is optimized for your room. These settings are adjustable:
Surrounds
Turn surround sound 
On
 or 
Off
.
TV Level
Adjust surround volume for TV audio.
Music Level
Adjust surround volume for music.
Music Playback
Ambient
 (subtle) or

You can customize Sonos products for your surroundings. Go to 
 > 
System
 and select a product.
Room Name
If you move your speaker to a new room, you can change its name in 
Settings
.
Turn off WiFi 
(not available for Sonos Era 100, Era 300, or portable products)
You can turn off your speaker’s WiFi when it’s connected to your network with an Ethernet cable. This reduces power consumption and can improve connectivity for wired speakers.
For products like Amp and Port, turning off WiFi can reduce the internal temperature when they’re placed in a rack or stacked. 
Learn more
Note: 
WiFi is turned off for Era 100 and Era 300 when you connect a 
Sonos Combo Adapter
 using the Ethernet cable.
EQ
Sonos products ship with preset equalization settings. You can change the sound settings (bass, treble, or loudness) to suit your personal preferences.

Trueplay
Trueplay adapts the sound for your surroundings and content. Portable products can tune themselves automatically.

Volume Limit
You can set a maximum volume for each room.

Status Light
Displays the speaker’s connection to WiFi, indicates when the volume is muted, and signals errors.

Note
: If the light is distracting, you can turn it off in 
Settings
.
Touch Controls
You can disable the touch control on your speaker. You may want to do this to prevent a child or curious pet from accidentally adjusting playback or volume.

Battery Saver 
(portable products only)
To save battery life, you can set your portable speaker to power off automatically instead of going to sleep. It won't appear in the Sonos app until it’s powered back on.
Line-In 
(Sonos products with line-in capability)
When a projector, turntable, stereo, or other audio device is connected to a Sonos product, you can adjust these line-in settings:

Each Sonos Era 100 Stand assembly includes:
Note
: Sonos speakers sold separately.
Take everything out of the box and place the base in the packaging slot to stabilize it for the next few steps. Thread the end of the Sonos Era 100 power cord that attaches to the speaker through the opening in the stand base and into the pole channel.
Caution
: This stand is intended only for use with Sonos Era 100.
Position the washer with the alignment pins facing in. Then align the stand pole with the base, using the alignment pins to guide you.
Fasten the base (with the washer) to the stand pole using 1 long screw (included) and a Phillips-head screwdriver. Make sure the cord can still slide freely.
Use the alignment pins to position the speaker platform on the pole, then attach the speaker platform to the stand pole using the other long screw (included).
Bring the power cord up to the speaker and plug it in, then neatly press the power cord into the cable channel on the pole, working from top to bottom.
Attach the speaker to the platform using the short screw (included).
Snap the pole cap onto the top of the stand pole to hide the power cord.
Plug the speaker into a power outlet, then tuck the excess cord under the base.
Important
: This mount is intended for use with Sonos Era 100 in a vertical orientation, as the acoustic and wireless performance of the speaker has been optimized for a standard table-top orientation.
Each custom-designed Sonos Era 100 wall mount assembly includes:
Note
: Sonos speakers sold separately.
Place the bracket against the wall using a level to make sure it’s aligned, and mark the screw holes. Remove the bracket.
If you’re using wall anchors, use a 5/16" drill bit to drill 2 pilot holes, starting with the hole on the top. Then insert the wall anchors. (Don’t use wall anchors if you’re drilling into wood or plastic.)
If you’re not using wall anchors, locate a wall stud and drill the pilot holes with a 9/64" bit.
Place the bracket against the wall with the arrows facing up. Secure it using 2 long wall bracket screws (included) and a power drill or Phillips-head screwdriver. Drive the top screw in halfway. Drive the bottom one in all the way, then tighten the top screw.
Thread the power cord through the opening at the back of the mount and plug it into the speaker.
Rotate the speaker 180 degrees so the screw hole is facing up. Attach the speaker to the mount using 1 short speaker mount screw (included).
Align the mount with the bracket keyhole, slide the mount down, and lock it into place. Make sure the mount and speaker are securely seated before removing your hand.
To adjust for optimal sound, unlock the speaker by rotating the collar on the mount 90° counterclockwise. Reposition the speaker, then rotate the collar 90° clockwise to lock.
