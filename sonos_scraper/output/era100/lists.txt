Setup
 when you’re ready to add a Sonos Era 100 to your system.
Volume up (slide right or tap 
+
 ) 
Volume down (slide left or tap
 -
 )
Press once to play or pause audio.
Press and hold to add the music that’s playing in another room.
Press 
>
 to skip to the next song.
Press 
<
 to go to the previous song.
When the indicator light is on, voice control is available (the microphone switch on the back must also be on).
When the indicator light is off, voice control is off.
Press and hold to pair a new device. 
Press once to reconnect.
Ethernet
: Use the Sonos Combo Adapter and an Ethernet cable to connect Era 100 directly to your router if you want to hardwire your speaker (helpful if your WiFi is unstable).
Line-in
: Use either the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter to connect your turntable, CD player, or other device.
When the switch is off (down), the microphones are disabled so microphone-enabled features like Trueplay quick tuning and voice services are unavailable. 
When the switch is on (up), microphone-enabled features like Trueplay are available. (Voice services are available if the voice services indicator light on top of the product is also on.) 
Era 100 is made to give you powerful sound anywhere—Trueplay tuning balances the sound for wherever it's placed, and whatever you're listening to. 
When Era 100 is placed next to a wall or on a shelf, leave at least 1" (2.5 cm) of space around the back of the speaker for best performance.
If you're using Era 100 speakers as surrounds, leave at least 8" (203 mm) clearance around each speaker.
When both are on, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are available.
When both are off, voice control and all microphone-enabled features are unavailable.
When the universal microphone switch is on and the voice services light is off, Trueplay and other microphone-enabled features are available but voice control is off. 
Sonos Voice Control
: control your whole Sonos system with hands-free ease and unmatched privacy. Sonos Voice Control comes ready to use—it only takes a few seconds to add when you set up your speakers. 
More information
Amazon Alexa
: you’ll need the Sonos app and the Alexa app with the Sonos skill enabled. You’ll make some changes in both apps during setup.

Siri
: you’ll need the Apple Home app. Add your AirPlay2-compatible Sonos speakers to the Apple Home app and then use an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV to ask Siri to play music (currently limited to Apple Music).

Source name
: Choose a name for the line-in device.
Source level
: Adjust the line-in source level if you find the default volume setting is too quiet or distorted.
Audio Delay
: Add a delay between the line-in source and Sonos to reduce the chance of audio issues occurring when you're playing line-in audio on grouped speakers.
Autoplay
: Choose a room if you want line-in audio to start playing automatically when Sonos detects a signal on the line-in port.
