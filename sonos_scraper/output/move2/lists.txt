Power
: Use a compatible USB-C and USB-PD charger (USB-C with 45 W, 20 V/2.25 A) for charging Move 2 on the go. 
Ethernet
: Use the Sonos Combo Adapter and an Ethernet cable to connect Move 2 directly to your router if you want to hardwire your speaker (helpful if your WiFi is unstable).
Line-in
: Use either the Sonos Line-In Adapter or Combo Adapter to connect your turntable, CD player, or other device.
For best performance, leave at least 1" (2.5 cm) space around the back of Move 2 when placing it next to a wall or shelf.
It’s ultra durable. With a tough outer shell and IP56 rating, Move 2 is built to withstand falls, bumps, moisture, dust, UV rays, and extreme temperatures (charging base is for indoor use only).
